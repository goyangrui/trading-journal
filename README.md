## Sidenotes Regarding Usage
1. It may take several seconds to load initially because I am hosting this using the free plan with render.com

2. Also when registering for an account, it may seem like you will have to pay to gain access to it after the week long free trial, but you don't actually need to. The Stripe account I have linked to this web service is in test mode. When it asks you for your credit card information, you can just input any dummy credit card info and it will renew your subscription. I have this setup just to learn how to work with the Stripe API.
